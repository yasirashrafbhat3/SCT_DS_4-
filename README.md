Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

Objective: The purpose of this project is to analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Additionally, the project aims to visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors using appropriate data visualization techniques.

Data Source: The dataset includes information about traffic accidents such as location, date and time, road conditions, weather conditions, and contributing factors.

Tools Used: Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis. Matplotlib: For data visualization. Seaborn: For statistical data visualization. Folium: For creating interactive maps.

Analysis Steps: Data Cleaning: The raw data was cleaned to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial exploration of the data was performed to understand its structure and characteristics. This involved summarizing key statistics, visualizing distributions, and identifying patterns.

Feature Engineering: Additional features were derived from the existing data to enhance analysis, such as extracting the day of the week or categorizing time of day. Traffic Accident Patterns Analysis:

Road Conditions: Analyzed the relationship between road conditions and accident frequency.

Weather Conditions: Explored how weather conditions impact the occurrence of accidents.

Time of Day: Investigated if there are certain times of day when accidents are more likely to happen.

Visualization:

Accident Hotspots: Visualized geographical locations of accidents to identify hotspots using interactive maps.

Contributing Factors: Created visualizations to showcase the main contributing factors to accidents.

Results: The analysis revealed several insights into traffic accident patterns: Certain road and weather conditions are associated with higher accident rates. Accidents tend to occur more frequently during specific times of the day. Identified hotspots where accidents are concentrated, highlighting areas for potential improvement in road safety measures. Determined the main contributing factors to accidents, providing insights for targeted interventions.

Conclusion: The analysis provides valuable insights into traffic accident patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. By understanding these patterns, stakeholders can develop more effective strategies to improve road safety and reduce the frequency and severity of accidents.
